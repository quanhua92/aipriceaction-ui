- **Flight to Quality:** All other banks dropped -5.8% to -7.0%
- **Banking Indicator Misleading:** VCB's strength masked by other banks' weakness

**Trading Lesson - EXTREME DEFENSIVE:**
- When VCB GAINS during market panic, it signals extreme flight to quality
- NEGATIVE_MEDIUM panic but VCB's strength suggests defensive opportunity
- Pattern shows VCB as ultimate Vietnamese market safe haven

- **Immediate VCB Signal:** VCB +0.12% during panic = Ultimate safe haven activated
- **Banking Hierarchy:** VCB gained while all others dropped -5.8% to -7.0% = Extreme flight to quality

- **Uniform F0 Panic:** VHM, VIC, NVL all -6.8% to -7.0% = Complete F0 capitulation
- **No F0 Haven:** Unlike POSITIVE PANICs, F0 didn't find safe haven in real estate

**Trading Psychology:**
- **Ultimate Flight to Quality:** Only VCB (+0.12%) vs everything else crashing
- **Institutional Behavior:** Even quality banks (BID, TCB) dropped -6% to -7%
- **NEGATIVE_MEDIUM Pattern:** Securities Indicator -7.09% = Avoid securities until banking stabilizes
- **Risk-Off Mode:** When VCB gains during panic, extreme caution required

**VCB Safe Haven Validation:**
- **Unprecedented Performance:** +0.12% vs market -4.50% = +4.62% outperformance
- **Ultimate Proof:** Only Vietnamese stock to gain during major panic
- **Government Backing Signal:** Implicit state support during crisis
